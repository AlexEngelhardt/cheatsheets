# emacs

## Help

- Emacs is self-documented. Everything you want to know is available *inside*
emacs
- `M-x describe-variable` and `M-x describe-function` to show info about
variables and functions
- `M-x describe-bindings` shows you all currently active keybindings

# Packages

- You can install `which-key`, which pops up next possible keybinds when you
start a key combination
- `magit` is a cool git tool!
- `treemacs` is a file browser

## Startup

- To see what all will be loaded on startup, do `C-h v load-path`
